    <h2>Locations:</h2>
    <!-- East Lawrence -->
    <h3>Hermitage, Missouri</h3>
    <p class="location">
      Our flagship store is located in Hermitage, a small town in Hickory County
      in the Missouri Ozarks. Hermitage may not seem a likely location to start
      a mercantile empire, but thatâ€™s not what the founder set out to do.  
      Time runs a little slower in South Central Missouri, where the routines from
      decades past are still preferred. Here, quality craftsmanship and fixtures
      that are made to last and be handed down through generations are appreciated
       more than mass production.  We try to gather together these products and 
       make them available to you.  If you are in Missouri, this store is worth 
       the drive. 
    </p>
    <!-- Mt. Pleasant, Michigan -->
    <h3>Mt. Pleasant, Michigan</h3>
    <p class="location">
      Serving Central and Northern Michigan, the Mt. Pleasant location can supply
      your lake house, summer cottage, cabin with the quality furnishings you are 
      looking for. <span class="directions">If coming from the north, take 
      Highway 127 to East Packard Street.</span>  We are conveniently located near
      a Home Depot, Tractor Supply, and Bob Evans, and across the street from the
      Soaring Eagle Waterpark and Hotel. Come make a day of it, or better yet, 
      enjoy the weekend in the Mt. Pleasant area.
    </p>
    <!-- Leander, Texas -->
    <h3>Leander, Texas</h3>
    <p class="location">
      At the gateway to the Hill Country and covenant to Austin, the Leander store
      carries many of the same items as our other stores, but also has item unique
      to a warmer climate.  However, items from our catalog can be made available 
      for in-store pickup without a shipping charge.  <span class="directions">
      From Austin, take 183A to Hero Way, the store is up the frontage road on 
      the right.</span>
