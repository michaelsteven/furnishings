      <h3>Body and Mind - Introduction to Goat Yoga</h3>
      <img src="../images/events/goat-yoga.jpg" alt="Goat Yoga"/>
        <p>
          Haven't heard of 
          <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2017/01/12/health/goat-yoga-oregon-trnd/index.html"
          target="_blank">Goat Yoga</a>? Believe it or not it's a thing. Yoga
          is not just for the young and in shape.  Many 
          <a href="https://www.greatseniorliving.com/articles/yoga-for-seniors"
          target="_blank">seniors</a> are seeing improvements in their 
          flexibility and balance.  Why Goat Yoga? Our customers enjoy yoga, 
          and we've got your goat! Being in a rural setting, we've got plenty 
          of goats. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Yoga instructor Stephanie Brooke will lead the classes, and all 
          "kidding" about goats and yoga aside, it's serious fun.  "It's 
          sometimes difficult to ignore the cuteness and stay serious" says
          Brooke.  She is mixing it up this year with a new trend, 
          <a href="https://www.wholelifechallenge.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-baby-goat-yoga/"

      <h3>Almost Amish - Lecture and Book Signing</h3>
      <img src="../images/events/almost-amish-book.jpg" alt="Book cover photo"/>
      <p>
        Nancy Sleeth has recently been spending most her life living in an amish 
        paradise. Dispite what "Wierd Al" Yankovic might think, we think she is 
        on to something.  Nancy didn't like the way she was spending her life, 
        and sought to simplify it. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Her book, 
        <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B007MATZXE/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_nNdvFbBWZPNZT"
        target="_blank">"Almost Amish"</a> is about making a consious choice to 
        limit (or in some cases eliminate) the hold that technology has on our 
        lives. By doing so,we can lead a calmer, focused life with deeper 
        relationships.  This would include our relationship with the Almighty.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Nancy will be joining us to speak aobut her environmental and spiritual 
        conversion experience. Prior to her new calling, Nancy served as a 
        communications director for a Forune 500 company. She now travels 
        throughout the U.S. speaking and writing about faith, and our impact 
        on the environment.

        preparing beans, and preparing meats.  She will also share some 
        stories about her cooking experiences.
